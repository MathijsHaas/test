Python Libraries to work with Raspberry Pi expansion boards from https://www.abelectronics.co.uk

#### 07-07-2017 Major Update - Now compatible with Python 2 and 3

Version 2.0.0 of the Python library has introduced several changes to the structure of the classes and demo files.  The major changes are listed below.  Please read CHANGELOG.md for a complete list of changes.

* Files renamed: removed ABE_ from all names.  
ABE_ADCDACPi > ADCDACPi  
ABE_ADCDifferentialPi > ADCDifferentialPi  
ABE_ADCPi > ADCPi  
ABE_ExpanderPi > ExpanderPi  
ABE_IOPi > IOPi  
ABE_RTCPi > RTCPi  
ABE_ServoPi >  ServoPi

* All classes and demo files are now compatible with Python 2 and 3.  The ABElectronics_Python3_Libraries will no longer be updated so please use this version instead for your Python 3 projects.
* Moved all demo files into demo sub-folders for each class
* The ABE_Helper class has been integrated into the board classes and does not need to be imported separately.
* Added a setup.py into the root for installing the this library into the main Python library directory.

### Downloading and Installing the library

To download to your Raspberry Pi type in terminal: 

```
git clone https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

To install the python library navigate into the ABElectronics_Python_Libraries folder and run:  

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```
For Python 3.4:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

If you have PIP installed you can install the library directly from github with the following command:

For Python 2.7:
```
sudo python2.7 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```

For Python 34:
```
sudo python3.4 -m pip install git+https://github.com/abelectronicsuk/ABElectronics_Python_Libraries.git
```
